this is just an example of my basic Laravel knowledge helped by tutorial. i also have to mention that technologie used in tutorial was Laravel 10.

app has the ability of registering new users and login those that are already registered. logged user can add jobs into listings and also edit and delete them.

as i said, it's just a simple project made for fun and in purposes of learning.
